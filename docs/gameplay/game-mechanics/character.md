# Character

A character is controlled by a player during its turns.

Characters can be very different depending of there **roles**, representing all the **attributes** of the entity, but also its **spells**. In other words, its way of playing.

## Attributes

Characters have several attributes:

- **Health**

    To play a character, he has to be alive. His health has to be more than 0, otherwise he dies and cannot be played again. 

- **Action time**

    When a character turn begins, its duration is defined from the character action time. So a longer action timer gives a longer turn duration, with more possible actions.

- Spatial attributes: **position** & **orientation**

    Position defines where the character is placed on the map. Orientation towards which direction character is seeing.
