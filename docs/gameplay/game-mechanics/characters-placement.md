# Characters placement

Before the begining of a fight, players should place there characters on map.

There is in all maps **placement tiles**. Characters can be placed only on these tiles, which are of state *default*. Each placement tile is attributed to a specific team, depending on how many teams map handle, and how many characters by team.

Let imagine a map with these properties:

- Number of teams: 3
- Number of characters by team: 4

With these properties we have 12 placement tiles (3 * 4).
